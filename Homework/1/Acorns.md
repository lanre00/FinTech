# Acorns Case-Study

## Overview and Origin

* Acorns
* 2012
* The company was launched in 2012 by father and son duo Walter Wemple Cruttenden III and Jeffrey James Cruttenden to promote incremental and passive investing.
* Since its founding, the company has raised approximately $100 million in venture capital funding. As of August 2019, notable investors in Acorns included Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Bono, Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Durant. PayPal, BlackRock, and NBCUniversal also have a stake in the company.
    In addition, since its launch, Acorns has charged a \$1 fee per month for its service. At this point, they offer tiered membership options for individuals and families with the monthly fee ranging up to \$5 per month.

## Business Activities:

* Acorns is in the investment management domain. 
<br/>
* Acorns' goal is to enable users to invest early and often and with minimal effort.
<br/>
* Acorns initially started by appealing to millenials that didn't have the know-how or means to make substantial investments with its micro-investing operations. However, Acorns new membership tiers will allows it the opportunity to capture even older customers. More than 1.6 million people now have an account with Acorns, with 75% of them between the ages of 18 and 34.<br/>
    Acorns is the investing app that rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference. When a user links a credit or debit card to his or her Acorns account, Acorns is able to track the spare change from the transactions and make it available for the user to invest. That is to say that when you buy a tall caffe latte from Starbucks at $2.95, the remaining five cents from the three dollars is automatically placed in an ETF.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
<br/>

## Landscape:

* Acorns is in the investment management domain. 
* In the past 5 - 10 years, we have seen the rise of investment management companies and banks that offer their customers the ability and education to easily invest their funds themselves simply using their app or websites. It has given rise to a more convenient method of investment that allows everyday people to solely build and maintain their own portfolios with access to realtime numbers.
